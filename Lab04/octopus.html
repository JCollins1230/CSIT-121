            <p> Hello. This is my first webpage. I am having fun learning about html, it's just alot to know and it's pretty intimidating.<br> I feel like there is alot of information to read through and process. I think taking this class gives the incentive to actually learn html. Without the risking of failing, I probably would've stopped trying.<br> So that gives me a little more motivation. I'm just more of a visual learner instead of just reading things. I'd rather see them in code to visualize what I need to do. I think my best bet is to just slow down and take my time to process.</p>
