                <h2>Lab 2 - HTML Basics</h2>
                <p> Hello. This is my first webpage. I am having fun learning about html, it's just alot to know and it's pretty intimidating.<br> I feel like there is alot of information to read through and process. I think taking this class gives the incentive to actually learn html. Without the risking of failing, I probably would've stopped trying.<br> So that gives me a little more motivation. I'm just more of a visual learner instead of just reading things. I'd rather see them in code to visualize what I need to do. I think my best bet is to just slow down and take my time to process.</p>

                <h2>Lab 3 - CSS </h2>
                <p> So this module is actually really fun. I love colors! At first I was having an issue getting the colors to show bc of the code I got from mozilla, but with some tweaking, I managed to make it work. Figuring things out is awarding all on its own. I know my site doesn't look to crazy or fun but, I have a hard time with color theory and choices, so I thought I should keep it simple for now. I also took the note I received on lab 02 about my code lacking structure and referred to lab 01.</p>
