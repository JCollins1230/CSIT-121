        <h4>The front page provides facts about homeless animals, options to make a donation, a navigation bar at the top of the page, a slidshow showing pivtures with animals, and more!</h4>
        <h3>Which CRAP Design Principle does this use? Provide one example.</h3>

        <H4>The audit score was unfortunately a 65%</H4>
        <h3>What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</h3>

        <h4>I believe the site is colorful, giving a warm happy feeling. The slideshow showing the pets and the amount of facts on the page are certainly important for the topic of animal adoption</h4>
        <h2>Recommendations for Improving this Website</h2>
        <h4>While the facts are important to know, I feel like they aren't as necessary when users are more likely already there to adopt or support and don't need convincing. 
            While I understand its important to thank sponsers and supporters, having all of their logos on the front page seems a little unecessary.</h4>
