    <h2>Lab 2 - HTML Basics</h2>
        <p> Hello. This is my first webpage. I am having fun learning about html, it's just alot to know and it's pretty intimidating.<br> I feel like there is alot of information to read through and process. I think taking this class gives the incentive to actually learn html. Without the risking of failing, I probably would've stopped trying.<br> So that gives me a little more motivation. I'm just more of a visual learner instead of just reading things. I'd rather see them in code to visualize what I need to do. I think m best bet is to just slow down and take my time to process.</p>
    <h3> What I learned</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li> How to set up the basic file structure</li>
        <li> How to do a DOCTYPE declaration</li>
        <li> How to use different tags</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Learning tags may be my favorite part. I learned a lot from:</h3>
